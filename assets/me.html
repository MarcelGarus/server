        <li>
            <b>I'm a student at the Hasso Plattner Institute.</b>

            <b>I do a lot of programming, almost all open source.</b>
            I have a bunch of repos <a href="https://github.com/MarcelGarus">on GitHub</a>.
            I work mostly with Flutter or Rust. Most notably, I'm creating a <a

        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Sometimes I write on this blog.</b>
            Most articles are about programming stuff, especially programming languages.
