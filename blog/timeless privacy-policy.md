## Collection of General Information When You Visit My Website

*Type and purpose of processing*:
When you access my website, the server automatically receives and records general information from your computer and browser, including information about your software and hardware and the visited site.
You can see the exact type of information logs collected [here in the source code](https://github.com/MarcelGarus/server/blob/main/src/visits.rs).
I may statistically evaluate these logs for the following purposes:

- *Administrative*: Ensuring a problem-free use of my website and evaluating its stability and performance
- *Content statistics*: Evaluating which content is popular
- *User statistics*: Assessing which browsers and operating systems my visitors use and which languages they speak

*Legal basis*:
The processing takes place per Art. 6 Paragraph 1 GDPR based on my legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website and evaluating the content and audience.

*Recipient*:
I receive these logs.
I might share them with friends or make aggregate statistics public.
Strato hosts the server and thereby gets access to connection metadata.

*Storage period*:
The collected logs don't contain personal information, so I save them permanently.

*Provision prescribed or required*:
No personal data is collected, so it's not made available to you.

## CATAAS When You See an Error Page

When you encounter an error page, a random cat picture is displayed.
To deliver a broad set of cat pictures, I use the service [Cat As a Service](https://cataas.com).
See [its privacy policy](https://firewall.oauthorize.tk/privacy-policy?client_id=cataas) for what data it collects on what basis and what it shares with third parties.

## TLS encryption

I use state-of-the-art TLS encryption to establish an HTTPS connection.

## Changes to Our Data Protection Regulations

I reserve the right to adapt this privacy policy to changes in the code and comply with laws.
The new privacy policy will then apply to your next visit.

## Questions to the Data Protection Officer

If you have any questions about data protection, please [text me](/contact).
