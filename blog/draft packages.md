# Package Ecosystems

## A sketch of a package manager for Candy

program dependencies are pinned by default

Structure:

- getting rid of dependency hell
- isolation, reproducability
- packages are self-contained
- packages as immutable code: a package can't be changed from under you
- sense of ownership
  - you're responsible for the updating of the package
  - you're responsible for
- challenges
  - breaking changes
  - changing data types
  - bug fixes
  - security fixes

---

Package ecosystems are getting ridiculous.

- is-one
- logging

What does it mean to use a package?
