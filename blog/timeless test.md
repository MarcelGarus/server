Hi, `mar:blub`! You are *bold* to ~~assume~~ that I _did_ stuff.[^mynote]

Hello.

- Dart
  
  ```dart
  void main() {
    final blub = "Hi";
  }
  class Foo { static int f = 1; }
  ```
  
  - nested
  - list
- Rust
  
  ```rust
  fn main() -> Result<u8, ()> {
      println!("Hello, world!");
  }
  trait Foo {}
  struct Bar {}
  enum Baz {}
  ```

And

1. A
2. numbered
3. list
